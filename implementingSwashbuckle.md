# Documenting APIs with Swagger...sort of

Our team starting developing a new API (in C#), which I took as an opportunity to implement Swagger (now the OpenAPI Specification), which is an open source project used to describe and document RESTful APIs. I wanted to show our developers and support engineers that injecting documentation into the code can reduce response time, mitigate errors, and decrease the point of entry for new hires. To illustrate those gains, I needed to develop a proof of concept.

> **Note:** This article applies to .NET environments. Swashbuckle uses [a different package](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) for .NET Core environments.

## Why Swagger?

Swagger is open source, and includes a UI to display your API documentation, which can be built from source code or manually in JSON. Swashbuckle, a combination of ApiExplorer and Swagger UI, enables Swagger for .NET environments, which was just what we needed.

## A Pirate's life for me

Swashbuckle requires a bit of coding to implement, but using [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) helps to manage .NET dependencies. With Paket, I can add the necessary Swashbuckle NuGet packages to my API project and ensure that they are current. If I need to add more packages, I can install and manage those packages through Paket.

After installing Paket, I run the following command to add Swashbuckle as a dependency to my C# project.

```
paket add nuget Swashbuckle.Core project <projectName>
```

Now that Swashbuckle is available to my project, I can add Swashbuckle to the ```Startup.cs``` file. I add each of the following Swashbuckle libraries so that the solution can access the necessary methods.

```
using Swashbuckle.Application;
using Swashbuckle.Swagger.Annotations;
using Swashbuckle.Swagger;
using Swashbuckle.Swagger.XmlComments;
```

Then, I add the following code, much of which is supplied in a Swashbuckle example file. In the ```SwaggerGeneratorOptions``` class, I specify the options that I want Swashbuckle to enable.
* ```schemaFilters``` post-modify complex schemas in the generated output. You can modify schemas for a specific member type or across all member types.
* ```operationFilters``` specifies options to modify the generated output. Each entry enables a different modification for operation descriptions.

After enabling these options, I *could* include code that enables the Swagger UI, but that interface looks a bit outdated. Also, I want to incorporate additional documentation written in Markdown, which the Swagger UI does not support. After reading online forums and posting questions to the Write The Docs channel on Slack, I discovered DapperDox.

```
//Enables Swashbuckle and related Swagger options.
 private void generateSwagger(HttpConfiguration config)
 {
     config.EnsureInitialized();
     var swaggerProvider = new SwaggerGenerator(
     config.Services.GetApiExplorer(),
     config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings,
     new Dictionary<string, Info> { { "v1", new Info { version = "v1", title = "My API",
     description = "Provides an interface between our software and other software. This API
     sends requests to verify things."} }},
     new SwaggerGeneratorOptions(
          // Apply your Swagger options here.
             schemaIdSelector: (type) => type.FriendlyId(true),
          //Implements the SwaggerTitleFilter class, which generates "title" members in the
          //"definitions" model of the swagger.json output.
             modelFilters: new List<IModelFilter>(){ new SwaggerTitleFilter() },
             conflictingActionsResolver: (apiDescriptions) => apiDescriptions.GetEnumerator().Current,
          //Enables schema filters, such as recognizing XML comments, including response codes,
          //and adding operation filters.
             schemaFilters: new List<ISchemaFilter>() {
                 new ApplySwaggerSchemaFilterAttributes()
                 },
             operationFilters: new List<IOperationFilter>() {
              //Recognize XML comments in the code and write them to the MyAPI.XML file.
                 new ApplyXmlActionComments("MyAPI.XML"),
              //Enable response code classes and attributes through Swashbuckle.
                 new ApplySwaggerResponseAttributes(),
              //Modify operation descriptions after they are generated.
                 new ApplySwaggerOperationAttributes(),
              //Enable operation filters and attributes.
                 new ApplySwaggerOperationFilterAttributes()
             }

         )

     );
     var swaggerDoc = swaggerProvider.GetSwagger("http://localhost:8006", "v1");

  // Serializes the swaggerDoc variable.
     var swaggerString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
         swaggerDoc,
         Formatting.Indented,
         new JsonSerializerSettings
         {
             NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
             Converters = new[] { new VendorExtensionsConverter() }
         }
     );

```
## Using DapperDox

[DapperDox](http://dapperdox.io/) is an open source documentation framework for OpenAPI specifications. Instead of having Swashbuckle publish our API specificaiton in the Swagger UI, I added the following code to the ```Startup.cs``` file. This code writes the Swagger specification to a swagger.json file.

```
   System.IO.StreamWriter file = new System.IO.StreamWriter("swagger.json");
      file.WriteLine(swaggerString);
      file.Close();
```

DapperDox reads this file and displays it in its own UI. I installed DapperDox and pointed it at my swagger.json file, and saw nothing but error messages in my command prompt.

Reading through the [DapperDox documentation](http://dapperdox.io/docs/spec-resource-definitions), I discovered that "When specifying a resource schema object...DapperDox requires that the optional schema object title member is present." This requirement was problematic, because Swashbuckle does not include a method for adding members to a schema in the generated swagger.json file. Additionally, it took some tinkering in the code for me to realize that the missing title member on the ```definitions``` model is what caused DapperDox to break.

## Fixing the output

The Swashbuckle documentation offered little help in this regard, so I turned to one of our developers. After reviewing the code together, my developer counterpart created a ```SwaggerTitleFilter``` method that adds a title member to the definitions model in the resulting swagger.json file. The title member displays in the generated documentation as a link to the referenced object, creating a hyperlink between the two objects.

The following code implements an IModelFilter that causes Swashbuckle to generate a title member for any schema.

```
namespace MyAPI.Swagger
{
    public class SwaggerTitleFilter : IModelFilter
    {
        public void Apply(Schema schema,  ModelFilterContext mfc)
        {
            schema.vendorExtensions.Add("title", mfc.SystemType.Name);
        }
    }
}
```
I compiled the code and Swashbuckle generated an updated swagger.json file. With the title member added to the swagger.json output, I pointed DapperDox at the directory containing my swagger.json file.

```
.\dapperdox -spec-dir=C:\Bitbucket\APIproject\source
```

I opened a browser and entered ```http://localhost:3123```, which is where DapperDox runs by default, and it worked! DapperDox displayed my swagger.json file and created interactive documentation that clearly displays the requests, responses, and query parameters for the API.

## Next steps

With this framework in place, we can extend Swashbuckle to future APIs and use DapperDox to host the swagger.json file for each. The resulting output is a swagger.json file that lives with the code, and documentation that developers and the support engineers can access locally by running a single command.

Each time that the code builds, the swagger.json file updates with the most current information. Developers and support engineers just run the ```.\dapperdox``` command and specify the directory where the swagger.json file lives. As the code changes, so does the documentation, so technical debt approaches zero.

To add documentation beyond just the generated JSON output, DapperDox worked incredibly well. The pain of determining why DapperDox was broken and the additional coding required to fix the problem was worth the effort, and we are poised to integrate this process into the next APIs that are developed.
